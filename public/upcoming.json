        "description": "The Mad Doctor of Gotham Jonathan Crane, also known as Scarecrow, has a twisted and dark past that led him down a path of obsession with fear. With a doctorate in psychology and specialty in phobias, he began experimenting on others with a hallucinogenic fear toxin he developed, unleashing their worst nightmares. But with this action figure, you can own a piece of his legacy and bring the fear home. The incredibly detailed design captures every detail of the character, from his menacing burlap sack mask to his tattered and worn clothing. The McFarlane Toys DC Multiverse Scarecrow Action Figure is not just any toy - it's a collectible. With a collectible art card included, featuring character art on the front and a character biography on the back, this action figure is the perfect addition to any collection. But that's not all - when combined with the rest of The Dark Knight Trilogy Build-a line."
